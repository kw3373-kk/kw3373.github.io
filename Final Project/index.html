            <p>Authority is one of the eight foundational tools of influence that play an essential role in any marketing strategy. Coined by social psychologist Dr. Robert Cialdini, the principle of Authority states that people are more likely to comply with a request or believe a message when it comes from a recognized expert or a credible source.</p>

            <p>In marketing, displaying authority is crucial for building immediate trust and reducing consumer friction. This display can take many forms: a doctor’s white coat, a framed degree, a high-level title, or in the case of luxury, a brand's long, prestigious heritage and highly controlled distribution. Without established authority, a brand is merely shouting into the void; with it, a brand can command attention, high prices, and unwavering loyalty.</p>
